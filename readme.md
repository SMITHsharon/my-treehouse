# my-Treehouse Data

### Project Description 
This assignment displays the given user's Treehouse data obtained as a `JSON` Object file. Except for the page header, all output is written dynamically to the DOM and styled using css.

#### User Input Screen
![my-Treehouse Output Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SMITHsharon/my-treehouse/screen/screen/my-Treehouse%20screen%20grab.png)

### Project Specs
1. Writes the necessary `JavaScript` code to launch an `XHR` request.
2. (Because my own Treehouse account has been suspended, I accessed the data for a classmate's file: `https://teamtreehouse.com/accountname.json`)
3. Writes the parsed data to the DOM.
4. Styles the output. 


### Technologies Used
